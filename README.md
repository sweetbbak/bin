# bin

**Useful scripts that I keep around in my ~/bin**

some of these rely on scraping websites for data and are therefore liable to fail after a certain amount of time.
Most of them have low amounts of dependencies. 
I tend to use things like gum by charmbracelet, fzf, yt-dlp, rofi, curl, ripgrep, mpv, ffmpeg, 
pixcat and the built in function in Kitty terminal (kitty +kitten icat) for viewing images in the terminal.
